# SecForge

## Overview Of The Repo

SecForge is a collection of practical cybersecurity and blue team engineering projects focused on detection, analysis, and defensive security automation.

This repository demonstrates hands-on implementations of core security concepts including cryptography, threat intelligence, intrusion detection, secure system design, and vulnerability assessment.

Each project is designed to simulate real-world security problems and provide working defensive solutions.
